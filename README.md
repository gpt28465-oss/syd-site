# Sayyid Musa al‑Sadr — Tribute & Legacy

This is a clean, fully responsive static site built with **HTML + CSS + a little vanilla JavaScript**.  
It includes bilingual content (English/Arabic), RTL support, dark/light theme, a timeline, quotes, a gallery with SVG assets, and accessibility niceties.

## Features
- ✅ Bilingual (EN/AR) with one click toggle — switches `lang` and `dir="rtl"`
- ✅ Sticky, mobile navigation with hamburger
- ✅ Beautiful hero, timeline, cards, gallery
- ✅ Dark/Light theme toggle with persistence
- ✅ Accessible: skip link, focusable controls, semantic markup
- ✅ No external frameworks; works offline

## Quick Start
Open `index.html` in your browser. No build step required.

## Customize
- Replace the SVGs in `/assets` with real images if you prefer.
- Update colors in `styles.css` under **Design Tokens**.
- Edit text in `script.js` under the `i18n` object (both EN & AR).
